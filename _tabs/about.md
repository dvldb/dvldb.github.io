<strong>DVLDB</strong> is an inventory of CDK generated Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates that you can use to test your defenses against possible misconfigurations and vulnerable settings.

Each supported DVL should include:
* CDK code for modification of infrastructure, including basic unit testing of infrastructure.
* Generated IaC template (e.g. cloudformation, terraform, kubernetes manifest) for quick deployment.
* Information about the vulnerability and step by step instructions on exploitation.

Use the DVLs to:
* test your detective controls
* learn about relevant monitoring information surrounding insecure configurations
* provide realistic training for security teams
* understand platform-specific insecure configurations and common vulnerabilities
